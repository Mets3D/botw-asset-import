- 'shaderassign>options>uking_material_behave' : 103 seems to be water, should check if our current function gives the same result or not.
- 'shaderassign>options>uking_material_behave' : 105 might be things affected by wind, it's mostly leaves and plants, but maybe also includes the clothes!? that would be great!!
- 'shaderassign>options>uking_material_behave' : 102 is always glass but I'm not sure if it is all glass. Either way, we could add some treatment for it.

- The add-on probably doesn't work with mods right now, since we assume we can find every material in the add-on's own database, which is probably not true for mods!

Importer feature ideas:
    - MaterialU.UserData.HideMaterialGroup probably tells the game what parts of the base Link to hide for a given armor piece. Could be fun to store and add related functionality to the BlankFile.blend scripts.

Map Importer TODOs:
    - Organize Far objects, Enemies, NPCs, Animals into separate collections so they can be disabled easily.

    Terrain
        - I started trying to refactor bmubin
            - We always loop over the whole grid, but skip certain blocks depending on what's returned by lod_ignore(), and I'd like to change that function to allow us to define a starting point and a size, rather than a point and a radius.
        - I made a very quick and dirty test of the material, but it will have to be generated procedurally in order to keep memory usage to a minimum (only load necessary textures for a given chunk)
            - Mix together all used material0 albedos (with most common to least common, generate nodes top to bottom, left to right.)
            - Repeat for material0 normals
            - Repeat for material1 albedos
            - Repeat for material1 normals
            - Geometry Position is plugged into every texture node. Can insert a mapping node inbetween as well for UV scale control.
            - At the end, blend the resulting combined material0 and material1 into the final blended albedo/normal
            - Hook up to some linked nodegroup so that if multiple chunks are present, their shading can be edited together.
            - Check if normal map Z channel is working as intended, it's yellow to start, sus.

Extraction tutorial:
    - Add images or videos of the resulting imported shaders and animations
    - Same for the ReadMe of the Git repo.

Asset pack release:
    - Need to re-do Obj_Objects because a bunch of objects have no textures assigned for some reason.
    - Need to re-do Obj_Fauna to fix transparency and add wind.

    Make a video showing off the whole asset library with the help of the convenience scripts in BlankFile.
        Remember to start off with factory settings or at least auto-run py scripts disabled, so I can show off the pop-up.
        Also show off SculptableTerrain.blend, maybe as a separate video.
            Could change the Blender image names of the terrain materials based on bmubin/linked_resources/json/terrainmat_names.json.
                But since we already zipped and uploaded, that has to be re-done. not worth.

- I tweaked Switch Toolbox to use a . for separator between object and material name, but now need to pack it up as a release build again if I want it to be available for others... sigh.

Should update the Kena and Witcher 3 asset libraries as well, if they even need to be updated, but probably yes. 
    For example, I don't think I marked Kena animations as assets, but might as well.
    Could also generate new thumbnails for them maybe, although I think these libraries used Cycles, so maybe not.
    Should definitely inlude BlankFile.blend (although maybe with a better name)

Future projects:
    Linkle
    Zelda
    Mipha
    Girly animations?
    Nude Link
