Import issues:
    - Shield material of Siteboss_Sword is not getting set up properly (should be a different shader)
        - Everything that uses an EmmMsk texture (such as Siteboss_Sword) should use emission scroll.
    - I'd be curious about `TwnObj_HunterHouse_A_01` in-game, since the current import adds moss to the wood but it looks kinda shit.
    - Weapon_Lsword_023 (chainsaw) doesn't import very gud.
        - We should probably stop adding any other guessed_textures beside dye textures...
    - Wrong UVMap assigned
        Obj_TreeStump_Broadleaf_A_01
        Obj_TreeStump_Coniferous_A_01
        Obj_TreeStump_Moss_A_01

    - Things that don't get their albedo hooked up
        Obj_Plant_HopBush_D_01
        Obj_Plant_Juniperus_A_Red
            And the UV nodes are also a mess because of pingpong+UV fallback not combining properly. I thought I had code for that!
        Obj_Plant_Juniperus_B_Red
        Obj_Plant_Juniperus_C_Red

    - There were also some tree ring materials that have a 2nd UVMap but shouldn't be using it

Material notes
    uking_enable_normalmap2 could be a candidate for whether material blending is used.

    uking_texcoord5_mapping
        1: only Gerudo faces and mouths.
        20: A couple of terrain materials (Horizon & TeraWater)
        21: Only Hylian faces.
        22: Only Hylian eyeballs (which is why this occurs exactly twice as many times as the value 21)
    uking_enable_texcoord5
        1: Exactly if uking_texcoord5_mapping is 20, 21, 22
    uking_texcoord5_srt
        3: Exactly if uking_texcoord5_mapping is 1
        5: Exactly if uking_texcoord5_mapping is 20, 21, 22
    
    uking_texcoord4_mapping
        1: Only GanonGhost Grudge. I forget if that's the first or third(cinematic-only) Ganon.
        11: Exclusively lava. (But not necessarily all lava materials, idk) TODO: Check shared properties of all materials with "Lava" in the name.
        20: A variety of eyeballs, generic faces, bodies. TODO: Check shared properties of all "Mt_Eyeball_L/R"
        22: Exactly if uking_texcoord5_mapping==21
    
    uking_texcoord4_srt
        2: Only water (not necessarily all water in the game.) TODO: Check shared properties of everything with "Water" in the name or if the name is exactly "Mt_Fall"
        4: Probably every eyeball in the game, probably every lava in the game, PLUS Horizon and TeraWater, PLUS GanonGhost, PLUS `Mt_AoC_Tenkyu_FirstDon_C_05`
    shaderassign.options.uking_enable_texcoord4
        1: Very similar to uking_texcoord4_srt==4, with maybe a bit more Grudge materials and some Hylian faces.

    uking_texcoord0_mapping
        1: Hylian faces and some dragon bits
        11: Some water, Horizon & TeraWater
        104: Lava
    uking_enable_texcoord0
        None: "InsideMat", "InsideArea", and some Tera materials like TeraGrass, TeraFlower, TeraTerrain
        1: Everything else
    uking_texcoord0_srt
        1: Some blades and shields. TODO: Import these and take a looksie?

Importer feature ideas:
    - See if we can figure out flow direction and speed of water and lava
        - Even if not, at least load a water shader whenever TerraWater albedo is used. Similar idea for lava probably.

    - I wonder if `uking_texcoord_toon_spec_mapping` tells whether toon shader should be used.

    - MaterialU.UserData.HideMaterialGroup probably tells the game what parts of the base Link to hide for a given armor piece. Could be fun to store and add related functionality to the BlankFile.blend scripts.

Map Importer TODOs:
    - Organize Far objects, Enemies, NPCs, Animals into separate collections so they can be disabled easily.

    Terrain
        - I'm not sure if I can trust bmubin's map_data that was generated because the file names don't align with the game's files. For example, 5100000001 doesn't exist in the game files, only bmubin afaict.
        - Ice-spear's terrain visualization looks pretty good, although I didn't compare it to in-game. But looking at its source code could be useful.

Asset pack release:
    - Need to re-do Obj_Objects because a bunch of objects have no textures assigned for some reason.
    - Need to re-do Obj_Fauna to fix transparency and add wind.

    Make a video showing off the whole asset library with the help of the convenience scripts in BlankFile.
        Remember to start off with factory settings or at least auto-run py scripts disabled, so I can show off the pop-up.
        Also show off SculptableTerrain.blend, maybe as a separate video.
            Could change the Blender image names of the terrain materials based on bmubin/linked_resources/json/terrainmat_names.json.
                But since we already zipped and uploaded, that has to be re-done. not worth.

Should update the Kena and Witcher 3 asset libraries as well, if they even need to be updated, but probably yes. 
    For example, I don't think I marked Kena animations as assets, but might as well.
    Could also generate new thumbnails for them maybe, although I think these libraries used Cycles, so maybe not.
    Should definitely inlude BlankFile.blend (although maybe with a better name)

Future projects:
    Linkle
    Zelda
    Mipha
    Girly animations?
    Nude Link
