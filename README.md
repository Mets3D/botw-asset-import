### What's this

This is a Blender extension to import BotW assets into Blender with a lot of automated clean-up. It includes various shaders which will be assigned automatically. It's intended for the creation of an asset library for use in Blender for fan-art and modding purposes.

### How to use
This add-on relies on Blender's .dae and .fbx importers. As of this writing, these are included in Blender 4.5, they just need to be enabled.

You'll also need BotW's game files extracted to both .dae and .fbx for ideal import results, as well as .png textures. You can follow any BotW modding tutorial for this.
