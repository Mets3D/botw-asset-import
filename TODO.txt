Environment / mubin import
    - Since the map asset database (mubin data) just ships with the addon, we can't import arbitrary mubin data.
    - The fences around Woodland Stables are missing, I wonder what else, and why...?

Materials
    - MaterialU.UserData.HideMaterialGroup probably tells the game what parts of the base Link to hide for a given armor piece. 
        Could be fun to store and add related functionality to the BlankFile.blend scripts.

Terrain
    - There are holes in the fucking map, and I really dread the code that fills them up.

Documentation
    - Add images or videos of the resulting imported shaders and animations to the ReadMe

Asset Pack
    - Need to re-do Obj_Objects because a bunch of objects have no textures assigned for some reason.
    - Need to re-do Obj_Fauna to fix transparency and add wind.
    - Kinda need to re-do everything because the shaders are completely different now... Yikes.
        - I don't want to do that, so I guess I'll just ship with two different resources.blend files.

    Make a video showing off the whole asset library with the help of the convenience scripts in BlankFile.
        Start with factory settings to show off python securit popup
        Show off SculptableTerrain.blend
        Show off automatic rig merging and animation drag&drop
