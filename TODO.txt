- Make sure Eevee is as pretty as can be (refraction?)

Importer feature ideas:
    - MaterialU.UserData.HideMaterialGroup probably tells the game what parts of the base Link to hide for a given armor piece. Could be fun to store and add related functionality to the BlankFile.blend scripts.

Map Importer TODOs:
    - Organize Far objects, Enemies, NPCs, Animals into separate collections so they can be disabled easily.

    Terrain
        - I'm not sure if I can trust bmubin's map_data that was generated because the file names don't align with the game's files. For example, 5100000001 doesn't exist in the game files, only bmubin afaict.
        - Ice-spear's terrain visualization looks pretty good, although I didn't compare it to in-game. But looking at its source code could be useful.

Asset pack release:
    - Need to re-do Obj_Objects because a bunch of objects have no textures assigned for some reason.
    - Need to re-do Obj_Fauna to fix transparency and add wind.

    Make a video showing off the whole asset library with the help of the convenience scripts in BlankFile.
        Remember to start off with factory settings or at least auto-run py scripts disabled, so I can show off the pop-up.
        Also show off SculptableTerrain.blend, maybe as a separate video.
            Could change the Blender image names of the terrain materials based on bmubin/linked_resources/json/terrainmat_names.json.
                But since we already zipped and uploaded, that has to be re-done. not worth.

Should update the Kena and Witcher 3 asset libraries as well, if they even need to be updated, but probably yes. 
    For example, I don't think I marked Kena animations as assets, but might as well.
    Could also generate new thumbnails for them maybe, although I think these libraries used Cycles, so maybe not.
    Should definitely inlude BlankFile.blend (although maybe with a better name)

Future projects:
    Linkle
    Zelda
    Mipha
    Girly animations?
    Nude Link
