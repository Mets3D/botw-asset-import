Material notes
    uking_enable_normalmap2 could be a candidate for whether material blending is used.
    uking_sampler_use_array is basically a guarantee, because `uking_texture_array_texture1/2/3/4/5` is only ever 1 instead of -1 whenever sampler_use_array is also 1.

    Trying to figure out UVMap assignments:
        `uking_texture_array_texture0/1/2/3/4/5` are only ever `1` if `uking_sampler_use_array` is also 1.
        So `uking_sampler_use_array==1` is a strong candidate to be the flag for materials that blend multiple textures together. HOWEVER... Out of 2810 materials that have this flag, 530 of them don't have ANY `uking_texture_array_texture0/1/2/3/4/5==1`. 
        These seem to be some statues, scaffoldings, house walls, and even a lot of materials that have "_Blend" in their names. Of course, a material that CAN blend multiple textures doesn't absolutely have to, so the easy explanation would be that that's what these 530 cases are; The material blending shader is used "just in case" an artist might want to mix materials, but they chose not to.
        But alas. Some of these materials simply have two regular albedos/normals specified among their TextureMaps, and they just want to mix between those.

    uking_texcoord5_mapping
        1: only Gerudo faces and mouths.
        20: A couple of terrain materials (Horizon & TeraWater)
        21: Only Hylian faces.
        22: Only Hylian eyeballs (which is why this occurs exactly twice as many times as the value 21)
    uking_enable_texcoord5
        1: Exactly if uking_texcoord5_mapping is 20, 21, 22
    uking_texcoord5_srt
        3: Exactly if uking_texcoord5_mapping is 1
        5: Exactly if uking_texcoord5_mapping is 20, 21, 22
    
    uking_texcoord4_mapping
        1: Only GanonGhost Grudge. I forget if that's the first or third(cinematic-only) Ganon.
        11: Exclusively lava. (But not necessarily all lava materials, idk) TODO: Check shared properties of all materials with "Lava" in the name.
        20: A variety of eyeballs, generic faces, bodies. TODO: Check shared properties of all "Mt_Eyeball_L/R"
        22: Exactly if uking_texcoord5_mapping==21
    
    uking_texcoord4_srt
        2: Only water (not necessarily all water in the game.) TODO: Check shared properties of everything with "Water" in the name or if the name is exactly "Mt_Fall"
        4: Probably every eyeball in the game, probably every lava in the game, PLUS Horizon and TeraWater, PLUS GanonGhost, PLUS `Mt_AoC_Tenkyu_FirstDon_C_05`
    shaderassign.options.uking_enable_texcoord4
        1: Very similar to uking_texcoord4_srt==4, with maybe a bit more Grudge materials and some Hylian faces.

    uking_texcoord0_mapping
        1: Hylian faces and some dragon bits
        11: Some water, Horizon & TeraWater
        104: Lava
    uking_enable_texcoord0
        None: "InsideMat", "InsideArea", and some Tera materials like TeraGrass, TeraFlower, TeraTerrain
        1: Everything else
    uking_texcoord0_srt
        1: Some blades and shields. TODO: Import these and take a looksie?

Importer feature ideas:
    - See if we can figure out flow direction and speed of water and lava
        - Even if not, at least load a water shader whenever TerraWater albedo is used. Similar idea for lava probably.

    - I wonder if `uking_texcoord_toon_spec_mapping` tells whether toon shader should be used.

    - MaterialU.UserData.HideMaterialGroup probably tells the game what parts of the base Link to hide for a given armor piece. Could be fun to store and add related functionality to the BlankFile.blend scripts.

Map Importer TODOs:
    - Organize Far objects, Enemies, NPCs, Animals into separate collections so they can be disabled easily.

    Terrain
        - I'm not sure if I can trust bmubin's map_data that was generated because the file names don't align with the game's files. For example, 5100000001 doesn't exist in the game files, only bmubin afaict.
        - Ice-spear's terrain visualization looks pretty good, although I didn't compare it to in-game. But looking at its source code could be useful.

Asset pack release:
    - Need to re-do Obj_Objects because a bunch of objects have no textures assigned for some reason.
    - Need to re-do Obj_Fauna to fix transparency and add wind.

    Make a video showing off the whole asset library with the help of the convenience scripts in BlankFile.
        Remember to start off with factory settings or at least auto-run py scripts disabled, so I can show off the pop-up.
        Also show off SculptableTerrain.blend, maybe as a separate video.
            Could change the Blender image names of the terrain materials based on bmubin/linked_resources/json/terrainmat_names.json.
                But since we already zipped and uploaded, that has to be re-done. not worth.

Should update the Kena and Witcher 3 asset libraries as well, if they even need to be updated, but probably yes. 
    For example, I don't think I marked Kena animations as assets, but might as well.
    Could also generate new thumbnails for them maybe, although I think these libraries used Cycles, so maybe not.
    Should definitely inlude BlankFile.blend (although maybe with a better name)

Future projects:
    Linkle
    Zelda
    Mipha
    Girly animations?
    Nude Link
