    Make UILayout consistent across all files, or at least files of the same type.
        Default workspaces
        Material Preview without overlays + solid view with overlays?
        Asset Browser with relevant category active.
        outliner, properties, action editor if necessary.
        maybe add ReadMe's.
    Should really add per-object and/or per-material shading controls (expose more sockets or add more Attribute nodes or both) for the rimlights especially.

    Batch .seanim import should set action slot names to the active rig's name

    Girly animations?

    Make sure to include all terrain textures.
    It would be wise to split it up into more files so people can better choose what they want to download and what they don't. (eg. a file for all foliage, one for all ruins, etc) But more scope.

    Should update the Kena and Witcher 3 asset libraries as well, if they even need to be updated, but probably yes. For example, I don't think I marked Kena animations as assets, but might as well.

Cleanup.py DONE
    Objects
        Apply Transforms
        Remove pointless "_Model" from obnames.
        Rename obdatas to obname
        Clean up custom properties of cloudrig/cycles
        Hide InsideMat objects from viewport and render, and remove material
    Armatures
        Make sure all armatures have a "Root" bone
        Make sure bone widgets are linked
        Reset bone transforms
        Remove 1-bone armatures
            Also remove Armature modifiers without a target.
    Animations
        Fix missing fcurve groups
        Remove keyframes at negative frames (usually default pose is keyed at frame -1)
        Remove fcurves that are always keyed on default value (even if we end up removing partial transforms, like only Y rotation)
        Remove useless bits from Action names
    Asset Data
        Improve names of objects, collections
        Make all asset collections hide_viewport=False
        Crop asset thumbnails

    Set lights consistently
    Report if any library is not from a neighbouring file
    Report any image nodes with no image

Cleanup.py TODO:
    Objects
        FldObj mostly: Try to remove "A", "B" and numbers from asset names.

    Materials
        Make sure SPM and Nrm textures are non-color and Alb are sRGB (although check first). Some Emm are sRGB and some aren't, so leave those alone.
        Everything has this awful metallic viewport material from the fbx import... Could try setting to the average or median albedo pixel.
        Could check for cases where a material uses an incomplete textureset (not as many of Alb, Spm, Nrm are used as exist)

        Re-ensure that active texture is most ideal; Albedo, or Emission, or SPM, or Normal.
        Materials using an SPM UV node but on objects whose meshes don't have an SPM UVMap need to insert a UV Fallback node.
        Could fairly easily de-duplicate SPM UVMap nodes

        Rename materials to the albedo name with _Alb ending (if there is an albedo texture ofc), and numbering if necessary.
        Remove unnecessary (dot) .001 material name endings.
        Remove any (underscore) "_###" regex match from material names.

        Make sure any uses of the Ancient Weapon Blade shader have the Alpha hooked up from the same node as the Fx Texture Distorted input rather than anything else.

        Could try hashing pixel data to de-duplicate textures. Otherwise, compare their average color and if it falls within a threshold, list them out.


Things I had to fix/do manually:
    Asset previews and catalogs
    Korok materials since they're procedural in-game
    Barbarian set skin paint
    Some meshes imported with some pieces weirdly on the floor:
        Moblin Mask
        Zora children (and maybe adults too, I forget)
    For generic NPC meshes, set albedo tints for the materials.
    A lot of work on assembly of Hylian NPC heads.
    A lot of work on enemy materials, and setting up re-skins as separate assets with shared mesh data.
    For many of Link's animations, the facial animation was separate from the body, so I merged them. (Sometimes the same facial anim is used for multiple body anims, in this case I duplicated the face anim and merged into each body anim)
    Horse items' icons for some reason didn't extract from the game, so I grabbed them from the internet.
    Was later improved in import code:
        Decal materials needed their Blend mode set to Blended.
        Some animals had the wrong textures hooked up.
        Some eye materials that didn't get detected as eye materials.


Could be fun to make a leaves particle system using FlowerFallenLeavesAlb_Slice_0_.png etc

If I were to make map importing work:
    - Many interior/exterior spaces houses are made of two files, an exterior and an interior (furniture). I combined these by un-marking one as an asset, and placing it inside the other. For these cases, the missing asset should be ignored when setting up the map.
    - A small handful of assets I've deleted since they seemed like carbon copies (I'll try to keep track here, but there have been others):
        - TwnObj_Village_IchikaraLamp_A_06 -> TwnObj_Village_IchikaraLamp_A_01
        - TwnObj_Village_KorokTreeLeaf_LL_A_02 -> TwnObj_Village_KorokTreeLeaf_LL_A_01
