- The add-on probably doesn't work with mods right now, since we assume we can find every material in the add-on's own database, which is probably not true for mods!
- It also can't import arbitrary mubins, since the map asset database just ships with the addon.

Importer feature ideas:
    - MaterialU.UserData.HideMaterialGroup probably tells the game what parts of the base Link to hide for a given armor piece. Could be fun to store and add related functionality to the BlankFile.blend scripts.

- The fences around Woodland Stables are missing, I wonder what else...?
Terrain TODO
    - I removed the call to Recalculate Normals, but it seems needed.
    - There are holes in the fucking map, and I really dread the code that fills them up.

Extraction tutorial:
    - Add images or videos of the resulting imported shaders and animations
    - Same for the ReadMe of the Git repo.

Asset pack release:
    - KEEP IN MIND I DON'T HAVE FBX'ES FROM NOESIS RN SO ALL MY ARMATURES ARE ASS.
    - Need to re-do Obj_Objects because a bunch of objects have no textures assigned for some reason.
    - Need to re-do Obj_Fauna to fix transparency and add wind.
    - Kinda need to re-do everything because the shaders are completely different now... Yikes.

    Make a video showing off the whole asset library with the help of the convenience scripts in BlankFile.
        Remember to start off with factory settings or at least auto-run py scripts disabled, so I can show off the pop-up.
        Also show off SculptableTerrain.blend, maybe as a separate video.
            Could change the Blender image names of the terrain materials based on bmubin/linked_resources/json/terrainmat_names.json.
                But since we already zipped and uploaded, that has to be re-done. not worth.

Should update the Kena and Witcher 3 asset libraries as well, if they even need to be updated, but probably yes. 
    For example, I don't think I marked Kena animations as assets, but might as well.
    Could also generate new thumbnails for them maybe, although I think these libraries used Cycles, so maybe not.
    Should definitely inlude BlankFile.blend (although maybe with a better name)
